                    <p style = "color: #aaaaaa">July - August 2019</p>

                        <p>Challenge For Change is an instagram-like social app with an added component. You can
                            challenge your peers
                            and journey together to achieve a common goal. For Team World Vision's Chicago Marathon, my
                            team and I created a fitness
                            iteration of this app to help team members achieve their fitness goals. The many features of
                            this app include a
                            feed of completed challenges that include likes and comments, push notifications, user
                            profiles, a leaderboard and an ecosystem of coins.
                            The app is fully adaptable for use in social campaigns and for raising donations.

                        <p><b>Concept and Background</b></p>
                        <p>
                            In today's world, challenging close friends/groups through social media is a growing viral
                            trend. For instance, the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge took the world
                            by surprise as they've acquired millions of participants and raised 115 million dollars. By studying trends such as the 
                            ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, we've learned that people enjoy participating in challenges
                            that are social, entertaining and have a meaningful purpose. The Challenge for Change app was designed
                            with that in mind.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Progressive Web App vs. Native App</b></p>
                        <p>

                            Along with a couple of interns, I researched the feasibility of implementing this
                            application either through
                            a progressive web app or a native mobile app. After extensive research we determined that a
                            native application
                            would be the best way to engage our targeted demographic for this app (millenials). A reason
                            for this is that the app was initially
                            designed to raise donations and we found that users easily trusted native apps with their
                            payment information (due to people's perception of web security).
                            Another reason is that mobile apps tend to have better performance and so we wanted to focus
                            on giving the user a better
                            and unique experience.

                        <h3 class="mt-3 mb-3"><b>Adoption</b></h3>
                        <p>
                            The design of the app was later modified for internal use within Team World Vision's Chicago
                            Marathon which removed the need for processing donations.
                            The focus for this iteration was persistent engagement for existing donors. In future
                            iterations, donations will be integrated once the app
                            gains momentum.
                            In conjunction with Team World Vision's Chicago Marathon, the app is also being piloted for
                            World Vision's 30 Hour Famine campaign. The app will be launched
                            for use within churches across Canada.

                        <p>
                            My teammate and I lead the end-to-end design and development of the application. Our
                            responsibilities/tasks include
                            designing the wireframes, selecting the front-end and back-end technologies, designing and
                            building the code, managing the database and
                            liasing with stakeholders to meet project deliverables.
